## Important Imports
Please make sure that you have poetry installed on your computer as this is the most import part of our code.
If you don't have it downloaded you can download it **[here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)**
## Download Project
You can clone a GitHub Repository easily by running the `Git clone **(http address)**`
or you can download the zip file for it from the github page. If you need extra help you can get it **[here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)**
## Installing Dependencies
Make sure you have added poetry to your environment varibales to use it. If you need help doing that you can get help **[here](https://www.eukhost.com/kb/how-to-add-to-the-path-on-windows-10-and-windows-11/#:~:text=Open%20Start%20Search%2C%20type%20%E2%80%9Cenv,to%20add%20the%20new%20path.)**. Once you are done with that open to the working directory and run `poetry install` if it says that this directory is not a poetry project then run `poetry init`.
## Running the Code
To run the backend code you can easily do that with a simple command from the root directory of the project. `poetry run python hacathon_practice/manage.pu runserver`
## Testing
If you would like to test the code then you can use a very important tool that we have used during our testing **[Postman](https://postman.com)**
## And there you have it
And there you have it a working backend code. If there are anymore bugs feel free to contact us at **kushdesai221@gmail.com**
